[**BlockDefinitionExtractor**](BlockDefinitionExtractor): a Python script to extract block definitions necessary to use Projector2Assembler and Projector2LCD with **modded** games that include non-vanilla blocks. You can download a self-contained version of the script in the [Releases](https://github.com/Juggernaut93/Projector2Assembler/releases) page. Installing Python is *NOT* needed to run the exe version. [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145) may be needed if you are using Windows versions older than Windows 10 (i.e. Win 7/8, etc.). If you have problems, you can still run the script manually with Python on command line.
